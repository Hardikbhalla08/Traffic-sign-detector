# 🚦 Traffic Sign Detector

This project aims to classify traffic signs using deep learning techniques. It includes a Python script to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for traffic sign classification, as well as a GUI for interacting with the trained model.

## 📁 Files Included

- `main.py`: Main python script
- `traffic_sign.py`: Package for classification
- `traffic_classifier.h5`: Classification Model

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python tensorflow keras pillow scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Upload an image of a traffic sign to the GUI and click the "Classify" button to classify the sign.
